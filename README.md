Comparison of 5 predictive algorithms on a imbalanced 0-1 dataset.
---------------------------------------

In this directory you can find a Jupyter Notebook with the study of a binary classification problem on this dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wilt

For this, I compared the results obtained with the following algorithms : 

- k-Nearest Neighbors (scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (scikit-learn)
- 2 hidden layers fully-connected Neural Network (Keras with TensorFlow backend)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

The Notebook provides results in terms of accuracy and ROC curves (AUC), and a discussion about the results (in French, for a course in ENSAE ParisTech).
